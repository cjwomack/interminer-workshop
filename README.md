# InterMineR Workshop use-case, 2019

## To run on Binder (no setup required):

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/intermine/interminer-workshop/master)

## To run locally, we assume you have:

### For the Pax6 Workshop workflows: 
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) installed
- an [R kernel](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) available
- the [InterMineR R package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/InterMineR.html) installed. 

### For the Enrichment and Visualisations: 
- all of the items in the previous list, PLUS
- See install.R for additional dependencies. You may wish to install them with BiocManager if you have a recent version of R (rather than BiocLite)

One these are all set up, clone this repo

```bash
https://github.com/intermine/interminer-workshop.git
```

Then move to the newly cloned directory, and run jupyter notebook: 

```bash
cd interminer-workshop
jupyter notebook
```
